## Do not deref inside lazy sequences

Hey, any idea why this doesn't work? Clicking on the button doesn't update the component

```clojure
(defn root-component []
  (let [selected (r/atom 0)]
    (fn []
      [:p [:button {:on-click #(reset! selected 1)} "Click me"]
       (map
         (fn [x] (str (= x @selected)))
         [0 1 2])])))

```
However, this works and update the component correctly:


```clojure
(defn root-component []
  (let [selected (r/atom 0)]
    (fn []
      [:p [:button {:on-click #(reset! selected 1)} "Click me"]
       (str (map
              (fn [x] (= x @selected))
              [0 1 2]))])))
```

(note the difference of where I put the str function)

dereferencing the selected atom inside of a lazy sequence, so reagent isnâ€™t able to capture the dereference and set up its tracking magic for you
if you lift the dereference out of the map you should see it work:

```clojure
(defn root-component []
  (let [selected (r/atom 0)]
    (fn []
      [:p [:button {:on-click #(reset! selected 1)} "Click me"]
       (let [selected-val @selected]
         (map
           (fn [x] (str (= x selected-val)))
           [0 1 2])]))))
```
