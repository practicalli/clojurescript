# Web Page

In order to run the **hello figwheel** project, we will need an HTML file to load the compiled JavaScript code into in the browser.

Edit the `index.html` file to look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Figwheel</h1>
    <p>Dont look for answers in this webpage, seek out the JavaScript console in your browsers dev tools...</p>
    <script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
