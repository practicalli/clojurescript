# Figwheel Project

In this section we will create a ClojureScript project using Figwheel to manage the build and auto-reloading of changes into the project

  * [Create Project](create-project.md)
  * [ClojureScript file](clojurescript-file.md)
  * [Project Build file](project-build-file.md)
  * [Run Figwheel](run-figwheel.md)
  * [Web Page](web-page.md)
  * [Run Figwheel again](run-figwheel-again.md)
  * [Add a counter](add-a-counter.md)
  * [Auto Reloading](auto-reloading.md)
  * [Serving assets](serving-assets.md)
  * [Using the REPL](using-the-repl.md)

> **Hint** Once you have understood the basics of figwheel, you can use a Leinigen template to automatically create a project structure and build configuration file.

> It is important to understand how Figwheel works, so its easy to change the project build file should you need to.
