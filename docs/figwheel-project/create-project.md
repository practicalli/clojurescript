# Create Project

> #### Note::Create a simple ClojureScript project called `hello_figwheel`.

Create the following directory structure

```
hello_figwheel
|_ src
  |_ hello_figwheel
```

In the the top-level `hello_figwheel` directory we will create a ClojureScript source file, a project build file and a web page.


> **Hint** Once you have a grasp of the basics you can use the figwheel leiningen template to create projects
> 
>     lein new figwheel hello-figwheel
> 
> The figwheel template can also add react libraries such as **om** and **reagent** 
> ```
>     lein new figwheel hello-world -- --om       ;; for an om based project
>     lein new figwheel hello-world -- --reagent  ;; for a reagent based project 
> ```
