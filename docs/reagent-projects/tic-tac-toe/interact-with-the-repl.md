# Interact with the REPL

Using the REPL gives you instant feedback as it evaluates your code.

When Figwheel is running it sends any saved changes to the REPL and automatically updates your application in the web browser, instantly showing you the results or bugs :)

You can develop the game with the REPL by saving code changes in your editor or entering code in the REPL directly (or a combination of both).

This section shows you how to interact with the REPL.
