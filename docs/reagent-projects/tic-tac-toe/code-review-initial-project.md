# Tic-tac-toe: Code Review - Initial Project

Lets take a quick look at the project files to see what the figwheel template created when we ran `lein new figwheel tictactoe-reagent -- --reagent`

## Project configuration

The `project.clj` contains all the configuration for the ClojureScript project.  This included the libraries (dependencies) that the project uses.




## Main ClojureScript file

The `src/tictactoe-reagent/core.cljs` file contains the code that the project will call when run.
