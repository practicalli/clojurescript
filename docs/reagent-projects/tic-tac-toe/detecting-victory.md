# Detecting Victory

So far we can play the game until all the cells contain either a nought or cross.

Lets add some code to detect winning moves.

A winning move is one of either

* a row of 3 consecutive noughts or crosses
* a column of 3 consecutive noughts or crosses
* a diagonal line of 3 consecutive noughts or crosses
