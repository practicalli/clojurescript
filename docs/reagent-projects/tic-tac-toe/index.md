# Reagent Projects: Tic-tac-toe game

A classic **tic-tac-toe** game where you have to create a line of three consecutive `X` or `0` marks on the game board before your computer opponent does.

The game uses ClojureScript, reagent and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for the game.  Bulma CSS framework is used to create a professionally looking web page for the game.
