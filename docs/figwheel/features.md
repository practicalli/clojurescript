## Broadcasting to multiple REPLs

Figwheel broadcasts changes to all connected clients. This means you can see code and CSS changes take place in real time on your phone and in your laptop

Its possible to run multiple browser REPLs by connecting a new browser to figwheel, by visiting http://localhost:3449/

This allows you to run **dev** and **test** repl's side by side.

For the **test** repl, Figwheel shows a test results indicator in the browser tab.  If all the tests pass, a green square is shown.  If one or more tests fail, a red square is shown.
