# Websites with ClojureScript
ClojureScript is a great language for creating websites, using data structures to define document structure around content and styles.

Websites with ClojureScript can use Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) frameworks such as Bootstrap and Bulma to enhance the look of a website and add responsive design.  So building websites that work across multiple display formats is straight forward.

Single Page Apps can be created using reagent, a React.js style library that abstracts the complexities of react with the data centric approach of ClojureScript.
