# Social Cards

Social Cards are visual previews of the website that are included when sending links via social media platforms.

Material for MkDocs is [configured to generate beautiful social cards automatically](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/), using the colors, fonts and logos defined in `mkdocs.yml`

Generated images are stored in this directory.
