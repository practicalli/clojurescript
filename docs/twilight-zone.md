You unlock this door with the key of imagination, beyond it is another dimention
a dimension of sound (sound design of a language)
a dimension of sight (the repl lets you see clearly what is going on in your code)
a dimention of mind (thinking functionally, thinking about pure functions and immutablility, thinking about data)

Your moving into a land of both shadow and substance (javascript & Clojurescript)
of things and ideas (data structures and functions)

you just crossed over to the Clojurescript Zone...

The boundaries are only your imagination
