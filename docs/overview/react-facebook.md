# React

React is a new approach in synchronising client-side state and the Document Object Model (DOM)

In the react API, HTML & DOM elements are constructed form similarly named React API functions.

## Om

uses Facebooks React API and requires developers to learn that API when developing with Om.


## Reagent

provides a programming & templating interface for facebooks react library.

Rather than the steep learning curve that the React API requires, reagent uses the more familiar HTML templates via JavaScript language extensions (JSX).  This is Facebooks recommended way of using React.


## Om-Next

does this use the API or JSX ?
