# Hiccup style syntax for generating HTML

Rather that write HTML code, you can use Clojure to write it for you.  This provides a simpler to type syntax based on the vector in Clojure.

Instead of angle bracket `< >` and tags like `p`. you can define section using vectors `[ ]` and `:keywords`.

# Examples

<!-- Hide the reagent include - too much information at this point -->
<pre class="hidden"><code class="lang-eval-clojure">
(require '[reagent.core :as r])
</code></pre>


So for a header you would write

```reagent
[:div
[:h1 "I am a header"]]
```

A simple piece of HTML (for web pages)

```reagent
[:div
  [:h1 "This is HTML code generated by Clojure"]
  [:p "Hiccup is a simple way to write HTML in Clojure, without all those angle brackets"]
  [:a {:href "https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup"}
  "Read more about Hiccup at its Github repository"]]
```

We can also create HTML for displaying images

```reagent
[:img
 {:src "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9254615?v=3&s=150"}]
```
