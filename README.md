> #### Warning:: Requires major update
> Requires a major update to catch up with changes in Clojure and ClojureScript, especially around shadown-cljs which is not yet covered.
>
> An example that is still relevant is the [TicTacToe game with ClojureScript, Reagent and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](/reagent-projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html)

This workshop is aimed at those new to writing client-side web applications using the ClojureScript programming language, a functional programming language based on Lisp and compiled to JavaScript.

ClojureScript and client side development are covered in a highly practical way, so you can evaluate where ClojureScript is useful in your own projects.

This workshop guides you through the basics of client-side web development and functional programming in ClojureScript.  Design approaches common to ClojureScript & React will be covered along the way.
