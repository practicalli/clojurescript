#  Live ClojureScript websites

> ####Info::This section is new, so feedback is appreciated

This tutorial guides you through the creation of a relatively simple, responsive website that is deployed live on the Internet.

You will discover how to use the following tools:
- ClojureScript - writing functions for sections of content
- Reagent - add basic state management to the website
- Bulma - a CSS only framework for responsive design
- Figwheel-main - an interactive development environment for ClojureScript
- GitHub Pages - a free service for deploying your website on the Internet


### Example ClojureScript websites
* [ClojureBridge London](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/), a landing page for the event using Bulma CSS, global navigation and responsive design.
* [ClojureBridge London source code](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/clojurebridge-landing-page)
* [Practicalli](https://practicalli.github.io/), a landing page using Bulma CSS (similar to the above)
* [Clojure Study Group project](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-study-group-website) a ClojureScript and bootstrap website
