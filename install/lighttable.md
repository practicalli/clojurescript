# LightTable

This workshop will use LightTable to help you discover Clojure.

 I have found LightTable to be one of the best tools to help you learn Clojure, especially the highly interactive Instarepl that evaluates your Clojure code as you type.

  LightTable is a modern development tool that supports Clojure, ClojureScript, JavaScript and Python languages.  The tool is open source and written in Clojure & ClojureScript (with a little JavaScript & CSS)

> **Note** Install Lighttable from [lighttable.com](http://lighttable.com)

**Linux** 
  Extract the contents of the downloaded lighttable file to a suitable directory (`/usr/local` or `/opt` or `~/apps`).  Make sure the `LightTable` file in the extracted folder is accessible via the system `$PATH`.

**MacOSX**
  Install the `lighttable.dmg` file just as any other MacOSX package

**Windows**
  Download the windows zip file for LightTable and extract the installer, following the instructions inside the installer.

## Using LightTable 

  LightTable has an online tutorial entitled [Getting started with LightTable](http://docs.lighttable.com/tutorials/full/)

> **Comment** I mainly use the Instarepl in LightTable.  I create a project first with Leiningen, open the project directory in the LightTable workspace and oopen any files I want to work with.  I then connect the open editor window for the file to an Instarepl.

> **fixme** my approach is documented in the [quick demo section of my Clojure & LightTable slides](http://jr0cket.co.uk/slides/jax-london-2013-light-table.html#/sec-12) from JAXLondon 2013.  This should be pulled into this workshop into its own section
